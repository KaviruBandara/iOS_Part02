## Tips & Best Practices

### For Families

✅ **Do's:**
- Set daily goals for each member
- Celebrate achievements together
- Use leaderboard for friendly competition
- Rotate difficult tasks fairly
- Acknowledge top performers

❌ **Don'ts:**
- Don't pressure or shame low performers
- Don't use as punishment
- Don't compare unfairly (age differences)
- Don't monopolize high-point tasks

### For Roommates

- Agree on task rotation schedules
- Claim tasks you're good at
- Communicate outside the app
- Set fair point expectations
- Review leaderboard weekly

### For Maximum Points

1. **Claim high-priority tasks** (more points)
2. **Maintain your streak** (unlock streak badges)
3. **Complete tasks daily** (consistency matters)
4. **Focus on one category** (unlock category badges)
5. **Check leaderboard** (stay motivated)

### For Building Streaks

- **Set reminders**: Complete at least one task daily
- **Start small**: Pick easy tasks on busy days
- **Track progress**: Check streak on dashboard
- **Don't break**: One missed day resets streak

### For Badge Collecting

- **Check requirements**: View locked badges
- **Plan ahead**: Target specific achievements
- **Diversify**: Work on different badge types
